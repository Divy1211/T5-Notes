## Concurrency

Given a semi prime, your program outs its prime factors within 6 days

1. Precondition - given a semi prime
2. Post condition - outs its prime factors
3. Non functional requirement - within 6 days

## Testing

1. Correctness Testing
2. Performance Testing

Ideally, with K extra cores we can do K times faster

Multithreading programs must be **efficient** and not have:

1. race conditions
2. visibility issue
3. execution ordering problem
4. deadlock
