press release

As all of you are aware, there have been more than usual reports over the past few months about inaccurate readings of our GlucoGauge Device. Over the course of this time, we have tried a number of things to help mitigate this issue.

Initially, we believed that the issue arose due to consumer misuse, and thus we updated and reprinted the instructions on our packaging. Next, we also provided images with the instructions, provided translated instructions in two additional languages, and also carried out a communication campaign with physicians to help them teach their patients how to use the device correctly.

Whilst we hoped that this would solve the issue, this was not the case. We later discovered that there was a possible error in the microcontroller of the device. We addressed this issue by shipping out a new device to all the people who had purchased our GlucoGuage Device. 

Despite all that has been done, we still continue to closely monitor the situation for developments and hope to fully resolve this issue as soon as possible.
